This project was completed with classmates for our final project in DS3000. My main contributions to this project were scraping and cleaning COVID19 data, splitting our data into various training and testing sets, running RFE feature selection to extract important financial features, testing various regression algorithms on our training and testing sets, interpreting the results of each regression and supporting the optimization of the regression algorithms.
